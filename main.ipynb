    "- Level 1 — Conceptual Nudge: one short question or reminder about a concept or invariant (1–2 sentences). Example: \"Have you considered what happens when the input array is empty?\"\n",
    "- Level 2 — Strategic Hint: point to a region or idea to consider; may include pseudocode of a small step or invariant check, but not the full algorithm. Example: \"Check how your loop handles the last element — what conditions do you use to stop the loop?\"\n",
    "- Level 3 — Structural Guidance: give a partial skeleton or pseudocode for the overall approach (no full code), explicitly listing the key steps the user should implement next.\n",
    "- Level 4 — Full Walkthrough / Solution: provide full algorithm and code only if the user explicitly requests the final solution by saying a clear phrase such as \"SHOW FULL SOLUTION\" or after repeated failures and an explicit ask for the solution. Always confirm that user wants a full solution before revealing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "HINT ESCALATION LOGIC\n",
    "- Start at Level 1 for first attempt on a new problem unless user requests deeper help.\n",
    "- If user asks for more help after a hint, move to the next level.\n",
    "- If the same error pattern has been observed in memory ≥ 2 times, escalate one level automatically and explicitly reference previous memory entries (memory_id).\n",
    "- Never jump to Level 4 automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "EXPLANATION STYLE (do’s and don’ts)\n",
    "- DO: Provide a short, factual explanation of why a hint is relevant and what to check next.\n",
    "- DO: Use small examples and one or two test cases to illustrate edge behaviors (show input → expected behavior).\n",
    "- DO: When pointing out complexity mistakes, state the correct time/space complexity and why.\n",
    "- DO: Offer a 1–2 line reflective prompt to the user (e.g., \"What invariant would make this simpler?\").\n",
    "- DON’T: Reveal step-by-step hidden chain-of-thought or lengthy internal reasoning traces.\n",

      "3. Diagnose: produce a short list of probable issues prioritized by likelihood.\n",

      "- Level 3 — Structural Guidance: give a partial skeleton or pseudocode for the overall approach (no full code), explicitly listing the key steps the user should implement next.\n",
      "- Level 4 — Full Walkthrough / Solution: provide full algorithm and code only if the user explicitly requests the final solution by saying a clear phrase such as \"SHOW FULL SOLUTION\" or after repeated failures and an explicit ask for the solution. Always confirm that user wants a full solution before revealing it.\n",

      "🧠 Extracted Mistake Summary: The code incorrectly handles the case for a single node and node removal when n equals the length of the list.\n",
      "\n",
      "✅ Feedback generated successfully.\n",
      "It seems you're currently facing challenges with the problem of removing the Nth node from the end of a linked list, particularly in edge cases where the list has one node or when `n` equals the length of the list. Let's break down your current mistake and then guide you toward a better understanding and implementation.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1. What You Missed or Misunderstood:\n",
      "You've recognized that you're not correctly handling the following edge cases:\n",
      "- **Single Node List**: When the linked list consists of just one node and you need to remove it, your code returns `null` instead of an empty list.\n",
      "- **N Equals Length of List**: When `n` is equal to the length of the list, often this means you want to remove the head of the list.\n",
      "\n",
      "These observations echo issues you've faced in the past, where missing or mishandling edge cases has led to incorrect implementations. Revisiting how to handle these specific situations is crucial.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. How You Can Improve:\n",
      "- **Clarify Edge Case Requirements**: Before diving into coding, write down the different scenarios your function should handle, especially edge cases.\n",
      "- **Flow Control**: Ensure that your checks for these edge cases (like checking if the list has one node or if `n` equals the length) are placed correctly and that they lead to the desired outcome.\n",
      "- **Consistent Pointer Logic**: Revisit the logic of how you are using your pointers to ensure that they are initialized correctly and that their positions correspond to the nodes you intend to remove.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. Step-by-Step Reasoning Toward an Optimal Approach:\n",
      "Here's a structured approach to guide you through solving the problem:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Initial Edge Case Handling**:\n",
      "  - Start by checking if the linked list is empty (i.e., `head == null`). If so, return `null`.\n",
      "  - Check if `n == 1` and `head.next == null`. In this case, you want the list to become empty, so return `null`.\n",
      "  - If `n` equals the total number of nodes in the list, you'll want to remove the head, so prepare to return `head.next`.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Two Pointer Technique**:\n",
      "  - Use two pointers, `fast` and `slow`. Move the `fast` pointer `n` nodes ahead.\n",
      "  - Once the `fast` pointer is `n` steps ahead, start moving both pointers (`slow` and `fast`) until `fast` reaches the end of the list.\n",
      "  - The `slow` pointer will now be pointing to the node just before the Nth node from the end of the list.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Removal of Node**:\n",
      "  - You can remove the required node by adjusting the `next` pointer of the `slow` node. Make sure to check your logic here to avoid an off-by-one error in determining which node `slow` needs to link to.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion:\n",
      "Consolidating these elements above will help structure your thought process and lead you to a robust solution. As you implement your code, remember to test it thoroughly against different edge cases you've noted down. This practice will enhance your ability to anticipate potential pitfalls in your future coding tasks. Keep at it, and you'll see improvement!\n"
